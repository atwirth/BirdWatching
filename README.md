BirdWatching
============
- This application allows the user to track his bird watching.  It allows the user to add a bird whenever they see one.  When adding a bird, the app allows to give the name and location of the bird, then the app gives a time stamp of when the bird was added.  The app also allows to go through the list of birds seen and gives the details.  


What did I learn?  
- I am not sure I have a complete grasp of this quite yet but the biggest thing (in my mind) that I learned is how to link a textbox to the code.  I am not sure what app I will be doing for my project yet but I would assume that textboxs will be a key element.  I can always look back at this tutorial if I forget how to do this too.  So when it comes time to use a textbox in an app I have a resource.
